### Encrypt-Decrypt-system ### 

**Supported Files**
- .csv .JSON .txt .exe And more but i didnt test more

A encyption system for ur files pretty easy to use


first u put the file path in what file u want to encrypt than u use a custome password or generator randome than u js press encypt the original file will be deleted but u will geta encrypted file that u can decrypt with the passwor u used like u put another path above (with the encrypted file) and put the password for the file inside the password field than u press the decrypt button the file will be there again js like the original file 

(i made this because i was bored) 
 I know that it works with .txt .csv files i didnt test more yet it doesnt support videos yet i will work on it tho
